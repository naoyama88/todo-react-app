# What I did

## initialization
- "create-react-app todo-react-app" on ~/workspace/
- delete all files in ./src dir
- commit to git as initial commit

## next
- just create the template of todo app as jsx
- then try to separate as component
    - at this time I'm little confused what to do, so I sometimes google to get what to do next
